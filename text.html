      A curated collection of Steve’s speeches, interviews, and correspondence, 
      Make Something Wonderful offers a window into how one of the world’s most 
      creative entrepreneurs approached his life and work. In these pages, Steve 
      shares his perspective on his childhood, on launching and being pushed out 
      of Apple, on his time with Pixar and NeXT, and on his return to the company 
      that started it all.
